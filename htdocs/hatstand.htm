</B></U></FONT><P>He stood in the corner of Harry’s Office.</P>
<P>He said nothing.</P>
<P>You could feel his presence, it was sinister.</P>
<P>His shadow was cast across all of Harry’s work.</P>
<P>Harry looked up from his desk and glanced across the room.</P>
<P>He saw a figure in the shadows.</P>
<P>"What do you want?"</P>
<P>The figure said nothing.</P>
<P>Harry swallowed and slowly moved towards the figure.</P>
<P>He could make out the silhouette of a man.</P>
<P>6’6 with a heavy trench coat and a sharp hat.</P>
<P>A noise outside, a distraction, a chance.</P>
<P>Harry threw a punch.</P>
<P>Von Hatstand rocked backwards and then struck.</P>
<P>CRACK!</P>
<P>Harry’s eyes rolled as Von Hatstands head butt impacted.</P>
<P>Harry fell to the ground.</P>
<P>Harry could hear the birds pecking at his skull.</P>
<P>He opened his eyes slowly.</P>
<P>He was covered by a grey trench coat,</P>
<P>And in the corner of the room stood a hat stand.</P>
